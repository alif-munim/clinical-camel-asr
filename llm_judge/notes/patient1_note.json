    "History of Present Illness": [
    "Ms. H, a patient with a history of left breast infiltrating ductal carcinoma status post lumpectomy with clear margins and sentinel node negative, ER+, PR low, HER2-, high Ki67, is currently on letrozole therapy. She reports persistent hot flashes and morning stiffness, with joint and muscle aches that improve with movement. She also experiences back tightness when sitting for prolonged periods, ankle swelling in the evenings, a small transient rash that has resolved, and a brief dizzy spell upon\n\nstanding. She has missed a few letrozole doses but otherwise adheres to her medication schedule. Bone health is being managed with a Prolia injection today and daily calcium plus vitamin D supplementation. Laboratory results show stable tumor marker levels, normal liver and kidney function, normal electrolytes, calcium within normal range, phosphorus occasionally low, vitamin D high normal, platelets occasionally high but without other red flags, and fasting glucose values higher than ideal. She denies new breast changes, new skin changes, or new breast symptoms. She reports use of an inhaler for asthma, a rescue inhaler occasionally, reflux controlled, thyroid labs within range, and blood pressure occasionally elevated. She has a history of knee replacement with physical therapy improving, and she is actively engaged in a smoking cessation plan to skip two cigarettes per day."
