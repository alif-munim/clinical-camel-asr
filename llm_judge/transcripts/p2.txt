Provider: Hi, Mr. Goodman. Good to see you back in clinic today. How have you been doing since our last visit? Patient: Overall, not too bad. Breathing a little better. I don’t need the oxygen during the day anymore, which feels good. Provider: That’s really encouraging. I’d like us to cover your labs, symptoms, and the plan moving forward. Does that sound okay? Patient: Yes, that works for me.

Provider: Good, thanks for clarifying. Let’s shift to symptoms. You’ve had neuropathy in your hands and feet. How are those today? Patient: The feet are still numb. I can’t stand or walk for long. The hands aren’t as bad—if I keep them busy, like working on jewelry, they feel better. Provider: That’s a smart strategy. Neuropathy tends to get worse with inactivity, so keeping your hands moving helps circulation and nerves. Has the numbness in your feet changed at all recently? Patient: No, about the same. Just frustrating. Provider: Understandably. Do you ever trip or fall because of it?

Patient: Sometimes I feel unsteady, especially if I get up too fast. Provider: Okay, we’ll note that. Supportive shoes and pacing yourself are important.

Provider: Let’s talk about your bowel function since the ileostomy reversal. You’ve had frequent diarrhea. How is that now? Patient: Still happens, especially after certain foods. Imodium usually helps. Provider: Do you notice a pattern—like after meals, or mornings? Patient: Mornings are rough. I sometimes have to stay near the bathroom for a while. Provider: That’s very common after reversal. Good you have Imodium. Any recent blood in the stool? Patient: A little streak here and there. They told me it’s from hemorrhoids. Provider: That fits. Let's continue to monitor and if the bleeding worsens or diarrhea worsens let us know. For now we will continue to monitor as long as it remains stable.

Provider: What about mouth sores? Patient: None right now. I get them off and on, but today I’m clear. Provider: That’s a relief. And the rash the Vectibix, the chemotherapy infusion you were on previously that caused your rash, How’s your skin lately? Patient: It flared up again on my chest and neck. It’s itchy. Provider: That can be tough. Gentle cleansers, moisturizer, and an antihistamine at night can ease it. Have you tried sunscreen when outdoors? Patient: Not really. I should though. Provider: Yes, it makes a difference, especially with drug-related rashes we will continue to monitor if anything changes, just let me know.

Provider: Let’s cover nausea. How often are you feeling nauseated? Patient: Pretty much daily. The Zofran helps, but I still feel queasy most mornings. Provider: Do you notice triggers—like food smells or empty stomach? Patient: Empty stomach for sure. If I get something bland in me, it’s better. Provider: Good observation. Small, frequent meals can help. Vomiting at all? Patient: No, just nausea. Provider: Okay, that’s stable then.

Provider: Any abdominal pain recently? I see left-sided pain mentioned in past notes. Patient: It still comes and goes, but not too bad right now. Provider: Anything that worsens it? Patient: Sometimes after big meals. Provider: Makes sense—your gut’s still sensitive post-surgery and treatment. Provider: How’s your breathing these days? Patient: Better than before. I only use oxygen at night now. Provider: Excellent. And still on daily inhalers? Patient: Yes, I don’t skip them. Provider: Perfect. Any new chest pain or coughing up blood? Patient: No. Just get winded with stairs. Provider: That’s expected with COPD and emphysema.

Provider: Let’s pivot to your labs. Overall, they are stable. Your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood counts have been steady. A few times your liver enzymes increased , but then came back down. Patient: When they go up, is that dangerous? Provider: Not necessarily. Chemo drugs, antibiotics, even alcohol can cause temporary elevations. The key is that yours returned to normal, which is reassuring. Patient: That’s good to know. Provider: You also have hereditary hemochromatosis, which causes iron to build up. That’s why your ferritin is higher than normal. After chemo, the goal is to gradually bring that down. Patient: So ferritin is iron? Provider: Think of it like a storage tank for iron. If the tank gets too full, it can strain the liver and other organs. But since we’re monitoring it, we can keep it in check. Patient: Makes sense.

Provider: Regarding tumor markers. If we look at these values your CEA seems to be slowly steadily trending upward which can be due to a variety of factors Patient: If it goes up, does that mean the cancer’s back? Provider: Not always. CEA can rise for other reasons too—like inflammation or even infection. That’s why we don’t make decisions from one number alone. We look at the whole trend plus scans. Patient: Okay, that eases my mind. Provider: You’ve also had ctDNA tests like Signatera and Guardant Reveal. These look for fragments of tumor DNA in your blood. Patient: Like a blood biopsy? Provider: Exactly. Think of ctDNA as tiny breadcrumbs. Sometimes your test is negative, sometimes it shows a signal. That’s why we check over time. You received a molecular residual disease (MRD) test that uses circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to detect and monitor cancer recurrence after your treatment and determine treatment efficacy.

Patient: I didn’t realize it could bounce around like that. Provider: Yes, it’s common. That’s why we combine ctDNA, CEA, and imaging for the full picture.

Provider: Let’s shift gears and talk about your imaging. Your last PET scans showed some small nodules in the lungs and some omental implants in the abdomen. Those findings are why we continue to keep a close eye. Patient: Those lung nodules scare me. Does that mean the cancer spread to my lungs? Provider: Not necessarily. Small nodules can be from scarring, old infections, or inflammation. Because they’ve been stable, that’s reassuring. If they were growing quickly, we’d be more concerned. Patient: Okay, so stable is good. Provider: Exactly. Stability is our friend. That’s why follow-up scans are important—to track change over time.

Provider: I also see in your record that you had a reaction to contrast dye, so CT scans with contrast are not an option. That’s why your plan now is PET scans only. Patient: Is a PET scan as good as a CT? Provider: Good question. PET scans are excellent for showing areas of active cancer because they pick up on metabolic activity—how “hungry” a spot is. CT with contrast shows anatomy in detail, but since you can’t have contrast, PET is the safer choice. Patient: So I’m not missing out? Provider: No, you’re not. PET alone still gives us strong information, especially when paired with your tumor markers.

Provider: Since your abdominal pain has been mild and intermittent, and your scans have been stable, we’ll keep the same schedule—regular PETs. Patient: How often do you think I’ll need them? Provider: Typically every few months. The goal is frequent enough to catch changes early, but not so frequent that you’re overexposed. Patient: Makes sense.

Provider: Now, let’s review other health conditions that interact with your cancer care. You have COPD and emphysema. You mentioned you’re off daytime oxygen now, which is excellent progress. Patient: Yeah, it feels good not to carry the tank. I still get short of breath with stairs though. Provider: That’s expected. Your lungs have less reserve. Using your inhalers daily is crucial, and it sounds like you’re consistent with that. Patient: I don’t miss a dose. Provider: Perfect. Have you had any chest infections lately? Patient: No, not this season. Provider: Great. Let’s make sure you are up to date with your COVID and Flu vaccines.

Provider: You’re also on Eliquis for blood clots. Have you had any bleeding—nosebleeds, gum bleeding, bruises that don’t go away? Patient: I bruise pretty easily. My arms look like I bumped into things even when I didn’t. Provider: That’s common with blood thinners. As long as the bruises aren’t spreading or painful, and you don’t have internal bleeding signs like dark stools, it’s manageable. Patient: No dark stools, just the hemorrhoid bleeding. Provider: Okay, we’ll keep monitoring.

Provider: And then hereditary hemochromatosis—your ferritin remains high, but our plan is to focus on bringing it down after chemo. Do you know if you’ve ever had phlebotomy treatment for it? Patient: Years ago, yes. They said we’d revisit it later. Provider: Let’s talk a bit more about your neuropathy. You mentioned it affects your balance. Do you check your feet daily? Patient: Not daily, no. Should I? Provider: Yes. Because of the numbness, you may not notice small injuries. A daily check helps prevent infections. Patient: Okay, I’ll start doing that. Provider: And supportive shoes are important—no walking barefoot, especially outside. Patient: Got it.

Provider: For diarrhea, you’ve been using Imodium. Do you know about hydration strategies? Patient: Just drink more water? Provider: Yes. While hydration with plain water is important (keep caffeine and alcohol to a minimum as it dehydrates you), overconsumption of water actually lowers the concentration of electrolytes in the blood and dilutes it. This causes you to become dizzy. To counteract this we encourage electrolyte drinks or broths in moderation during episodes of diarrhea to maintain electrolyte balance.

Patient: That explains why I sometimes feel lightheaded after a bad day of diarrhea. Provider: Exactly. So alternate fluids to keep your balance.

Provider: About nausea—you mentioned mornings are worse. Taking Zofran before you even get out of bed can help, almost like pre-treating. Patient: I usually wait until I feel sick. Provider: Try taking it first thing. That can blunt the morning wave. Patient: I’ll try that tomorrow.

Provider: Now let’s revisit the skin rash. Drug-related rashes often flare in sun-exposed areas. Sunscreen and a wide-brimmed hat can protect you. Patient: I ride my motorcycle, so sun hits me a lot.

Provider: You’re also on Eliquis for blood clots. Have you had any bleeding—nosebleeds, gum bleeding, bruises that don’t go away? Patient: I bruise pretty easily. My arms look like I bumped into things even when I didn’t. Provider: That’s common with blood thinners. As long as the bruises aren’t spreading or painful, and you don’t have internal bleeding signs like dark stools, it’s manageable. Patient: No dark stools, just the hemorrhoid bleeding. Provider: Okay, we’ll keep monitoring.

Provider: And then hereditary hemochromatosis—your ferritin remains high, but our plan is to focus on bringing it down after chemo. Do you know if you’ve ever had phlebotomy treatment for it? Patient: Years ago, yes. They said we’d revisit it later. Provider: Let’s talk a bit more about your neuropathy. You mentioned it affects your balance. Do you check your feet daily? Patient: Not daily, no. Should I? Provider: Yes. Because of the numbness, you may not notice small injuries. A daily check helps prevent infections. Patient: Okay, I’ll start doing that. Provider: And supportive shoes are important—no walking barefoot, especially outside. Patient: Got it.

Provider: Now let’s revisit the skin rash. Drug-related rashes often flare in sun-exposed areas. Sunscreen and a wide-brimmed hat can protect you. Patient: I ride my motorcycle, so sun hits me a lot.

Provider: Have you ever tried nicotine replacement, like patches, gum, or lozenges? Patient: I tried gum once, but it made me queasy. Provider: Some people find patches easier because it’s steady, no chewing involved. Patient: I never gave patches a fair try. Provider: They could help smooth the cravings, so it’s less of a roller coaster.

Provider: Another approach is medication—like varenicline or bupropion. Have you heard of those? Patient: I’ve heard names, but I don’t know much about them. Provider: They change how the brain responds to nicotine, so cravings weaken. Some patients find they don’t even enjoy smoking after a few weeks. Patient: That would be a miracle. Provider: It’s not magic, but it does give your willpower backup.

Patient: What happens if I never quit? I mean, I know it’s bad, but how much worse? Provider: Good question. Smoking makes your lungs less able to fight infections, slows healing from surgery, and increases the chance of cancer returning. It’s like stacking bricks on a wall you’re already trying to climb. Patient: That’s not a picture I want to see. Provider: But you asked the hard question—and that shows you’re thinking about change.

Provider: If you were to quit, what would be the biggest benefit you’d look forward to? Patient: Breathing. I’d love to walk without gasping. Provider: That’s a strong motivator. When your lungs work better, everything in daily life gets easier. Patient: Yeah, even climbing the stairs at home.

Provider: What would you say is the hardest part about taking that first step? Patient: I don’t want to fail again. I’ve quit and relapsed so many times. Provider: That’s a normal fear. Think of it this way: each quit attempt teaches your brain what doesn’t work, so you’re closer to finding what does. Patient: I never thought of it like that. Provider: You’re not starting from zero—you’re starting from experience.

Provider: For now, I’ll encourage you to set a small, specific goal. Maybe smoke one less cigarette per day. How would that feel? Patient: Less scary than quitting outright. Provider: Exactly. Even small reductions give your lungs relief.

Provider: Let’s also talk about fatigue and mood. Have you noticed your energy or mood dipping since starting treatment? Patient: All the time. Some days I don’t want to get out of bed.

Provider: That’s common, and it’s not just “in your head.” Cancer, treatment, and low oxygen all weigh on the body. Patient: It makes me feel lazy. Provider: Your body has been through a lot, you’re still on your treatment journey, give yourself some grace. But gentle activity, as we talked about, can help lift both energy and mood.

Provider: Do you have support at home—family, friends, someone who helps you day to day? Patient: My brother checks in sometimes, but I mostly manage on my own. Provider: That’s a lot to carry. Have you considered a support group? Patient: I don’t know if I’m the group type. Provider: Many people feel that way, but hearing from others with the same struggles can be grounding. Patient: Maybe. I’ll think about it.

Provider: How’s your appetite these days? Patient: Better than before—I actually gained a few pounds. Provider: That’s excellent. Weight stability is a good sign of strength. Patient: Still, some foods don’t taste the same. Provider: That’s from treatment, and it often improves. Using spices, marinades, or citrus can make foods more appealing. Provider: Let’s recap the key points so far. First, your cancer is stable on imaging. Second, we’re continuing PET scans every few months. Third, your COPD is better controlled, but quitting smoking remains a priority. Fourth, neuropathy, diarrhea, rash, and fatigue are being managed with strategies we discussed. Patient: That’s a lot, but it helps to hear it all lined up. Provider: And finally, we’ll keep monitoring your labs—CEA, ferritin, and ctDNA—to catch any early signs of recurrence.

Patient: What should I be looking out for at home? Provider: Great question. Red flags include new bleeding, sudden weight loss, severe abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, bloating, persistent changes in bowel habits, worsening fatigue, or unexplained fevers. If any of those appear, call us right away. Patient: Okay, I’ll watch for that.

Provider: Another thing—we encourage patients to bring a written list of questions to each visit. It keeps us focused on what matters to you. Patient: I usually forget half of what I wanted to ask. Provider: Exactly—writing them down takes that pressure off.

Provider: To conclude our time today, I want you to tell me what you heard and understood from today’s visit in your own words. Can you tell me, in your own words, what you understood from today’s discussion? Patient: Sure. My cancer’s stable, so I’ll keep getting PET scans. I need to check my feet daily for neuropathy. For diarrhea, I should use electrolytes, not just water. For nausea, take Zofran before I feel sick. And for the rash, sunscreen and protective clothing. Provider: Perfect. That shows you really understood. Patient: And I should think about smoking reduction, maybe with patches or medicine. Provider: Exactly. You summarized it well.

Provider: Do you have any lingering worries we haven’t touched on? Patient: Just the fear of recurrence. I can’t stop thinking about it. Provider: That’s normal. Recurrence is always on patients’ minds. What helps is knowing we’re monitoring closely—scans, labs, and your own awareness. You’re not alone in this. Patient: That does help.

Provider: You’ve done an excellent job today—honest, thoughtful, engaged. Those qualities make a real difference in your care. Patient: Thanks. Sometimes I feel like I’m just complaining. Provider: Not at all. Sharing your experience is the core of good care. Without your voice, we wouldn’t know how to adjust. Patient: That’s good to hear.

Provider: We’ll see you back after your next scan. In the meantime, focus on what you can control—hydration, activity, smoking reduction, and writing down questions. Patient: Okay, I’ll work on that. Provider: Great. And remember, call us if anything feels off. Don’t wait until the next visit. Patient: Got it. Thank you, Doc. Provider: You’re welcome. We’re in this together.
