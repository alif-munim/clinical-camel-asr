DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Thompson. I appreciate you coming in today. How are you feeling overall? PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest, especially about the lesion we discussed last time. DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. Today, I'd like to review your current symptoms, discuss our findings, and outline the steps we need to take next. Can you tell me if you’ve experienced any new pain or changes around the lesion? PATIENT: Yes, I have noticed that the area near my forearm has become slightly tender and appears a bit larger than before. DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. Based on the examination and your symptoms, I am concerned that there may be an underlying pathology. We believe there’s a possibility of Squamous Cell Carcinoma developing in this area. PATIENT: Squamous Cell Carcinoma? That sounds serious. Could you explain what that entails, Doctor? DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Thompson. Squamous Cell Carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that arises from the squamous cells, which make up the outer layer of the skin. It can be aggressive if not identified and managed early. Given your lesion’s characteristics and changes, we need to

investigate further. PATIENT: I appreciate the explanation. What exactly would the next steps be in terms of diagnosing it? DOCTOR: The next step is to perform a biopsy of the lesion. The biopsy will allow us to obtain a tissue sample for histopathological analysis, which is essential for confirming the diagnosis. PATIENT: Understood. And what does the biopsy procedure involve? DOCTOR: In a biopsy, we will use a local anesthetic to numb the area and then remove a small portion of the lesion. There is minimal risk, but it is important for us to have your informed consent both for the general procedure and specifically for the biopsy. PATIENT: I want to ensure I fully understand the risks and benefits before consenting. Could you provide more details about potential side effects or complications? DOCTOR: Absolutely. The risks are minimal and may include slight bleeding, infection, or discomfort at the biopsy site. However, these complications are uncommon, and the procedure is generally safe. Knowing these details, does it help you feel more comfortable with giving consent? PATIENT: Yes, it does. I agree that the benefits of knowing the exact nature of the lesion outweigh the small risks involved. DOCTOR: I'm glad to hear that. Before we proceed, I also want to introduce you to our pharmacist, Mr. Lee, who will discuss any medication adjustments and answer questions about drug interactions during your treatment course. PHARMACIST: Good morning, Mrs. Thompson. I’ll be reviewing any medications you’re taking and ensuring that they won’t interfere with the procedure or any subsequent treatments, especially if chemotherapy becomes necessary. PATIENT: Good morning, Mr. Lee. I appreciate your thorough approach. I have been taking a few medications for hypertension and arthritis. Will those affect the biopsy or any potential treatment plans? PHARMACIST: I’ve already reviewed your medication list, and currently, there is no significant contraindication with the biopsy procedure. However, should we move toward any systemic treatment for Squamous Cell Carcinoma in the future, I will work closely with you and your medical team regarding drug interactions. DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lee. Mrs. Thompson, I also want to mention that, given your history and the lesion’s characteristics, we’ll also schedule further imaging studies after the biopsy to better understand the extent, if needed. PATIENT: That makes sense. I’m glad there’s a plan in place for comprehensive evaluation. What kind of imaging studies might I undergo? DOCTOR: Depending on the biopsy results, we might consider a CT scan to assess any potential spread. This ensures that we can stage the cancer accurately if Squamous Cell Carcinoma is confirmed.

PATIENT: I appreciate the clarity, Doctor. I also value the detailed discussion that helps me understand why each step is necessary. DOCTOR: Your understanding is crucial, especially since decisions regarding treatment can be complex. I want to ensure that you have all the information needed to make informed decisions. How do you feel about proceeding with the biopsy? PATIENT: I feel informed and comfortable with moving forward. I consent to the biopsy as well as the general evaluation procedures. DOCTOR: Thank you for your consent, Mrs. Thompson. I will have you sign a consent form that details the procedure, and our team will ensure that you are fully briefed before anything is done. PATIENT: That sounds appropriate. I trust that everything is being done with my best interest in mind. DOCTOR: Absolutely. We take patient consent and communication very seriously. I also want to mention that if at any point you have additional questions, we can always revisit any aspect of your care. PATIENT: I appreciate that level of transparency. With my background and having earned a Doctoral Degree, I like to understand the nuances of my care. DOCTOR: Your medical knowledge is certainly an asset in these discussions. Now, aside from the lesion, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently that we should be aware of? PATIENT: I have been experiencing some fatigue and a slight decrease in appetite, which I thought might be related to aging. Should I be concerned about these symptoms given the current situation? DOCTOR: It’s wise to mention these symptoms. While they might be related to normal aging, when combined with the possibility of a malignancy like Squamous Cell Carcinoma, it’s important we monitor them closely. Our imaging studies and regular follow-ups will help address these concerns. PATIENT: Understood. I’m relieved that we’re taking a comprehensive approach. DOCTOR: Very good. After the biopsy, once we receive the results, we will have another consultation to devise a more targeted treatment plan. It may involve surgery, radiation, or other therapies depending on the stage and aggressiveness of the carcinoma. PATIENT: Will the treatment options differ greatly if the cancer is localized versus more advanced? DOCTOR: Yes, indeed. If the cancer is localized, surgical excision or localized radiation might suffice. If it’s advanced, we could consider systemic therapies, and as Mr. Lee mentioned earlier, I’ll coordinate with him to optimize your medication regimen and manage any potential interactions. PATIENT: I’m grateful for that approach. It seems very thorough, and I value a multidisciplinary team in my care. PHARMACIST: Mrs. Thompson, I also want to mention that should you require supportive care during any systemic treatment, we have several options to manage side effects effectively, ensuring

you remain as comfortable as possible. PATIENT: Thank you for that reassurance, Mr. Lee. I have always believed that a team approach is best in addressing complex conditions like this. DOCTOR: Exactly. Do you have any concerns about the biopsy procedure itself or any questions regarding the process today? PATIENT: I’m mainly curious about the recovery process. How soon can I expect to resume my normal activities after the biopsy? DOCTOR: In most cases, patients recover quickly from a biopsy. The site might be tender for a few days, but there is no significant downtime. We will provide you with detailed post-procedure care instructions and ensure you have everything you need to manage any discomfort. PATIENT: That is reassuring to hear. I want to maintain my daily routines as much as possible. DOCTOR: It’s important to balance diligence with your quality of life, and we recognize that especially considering your active lifestyle. We have scheduled the biopsy for later this afternoon. Do you need additional time to review the consent form? PATIENT: Not at all. I have read many consent forms before, and I’m comfortable with what is outlined. I will sign it immediately. DOCTOR: That is excellent. I will now prepare the consent documents and have Mr. Lee, our pharmacist, review them with you again if needed to answer any detailed questions regarding medications. PATIENT: Thank you very much, both of you, for taking the time to go over everything. I feel well supported and clearly informed. PHARMACIST: It is our pleasure, Mrs. Thompson. I will be here throughout the procedure and afterward if you have any questions about pain management or other supportive medications. DOCTOR: I appreciate your cooperation, Mrs. Thompson. Let's proceed with final preparations. Your health and well-being are our top priority, and we will continue to keep you updated at every step. PATIENT: I am truly grateful for this comprehensive approach to care. I look forward to the next steps and will await the biopsy results with confidence. DOCTOR: We will schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as the results come in to discuss the findings and determine the appropriate treatment plan. Thank you for your trust and active participation in your care. PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor, and thank you, Mr. Lee, for your guidance as well. I feel prepared for the procedure and the journey ahead. PHARMACIST: You’re welcome, Mrs. Thompson. Remember, we’re here to support you at every stage of this process. DOCTOR: Let’s get started today, and we’ll continue our conversation after the procedure to review the immediate post-biopsy care instructions. Your informed consent today is a crucial part of your treatment plan.
