THIS RAW TRANSCRIPTION MUST BE ERROR-FREE, COMPLETE, AND PRESERVE ALL SPEECH FEATURES VERBATIM. DO NOT WORRY ABOUT FORMAT OR LISTING. MAKE THE TRANSCRIPT AS ACCURATE AND NUANCE-CAPTURING AS POSSIBLE. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK. SECONDARY TASK: ONLY AFTER THE RAW TRANSCRIPTION IS FINAL AND VERIFIED AS ERROR-FREE, FORMAT IT INTO A NUMBERED LIST OF COMPLETE SENTENCES, EXACTLY AS SHOWN IN THE EXAMPLE. TREAT THIS AS A SEPARATE, FOLLOW-UP STEP THAT MUST NOT AFFECT THE PRIMARY TASK. **IMPORTANT:** THE PRIMARY GOAL IS TO PRODUCE A PERFECT, ERROR-FREE, VERBATIM TRANSCRIPT. THE FORMATTING IS SECONDARY AND TO BE DONE ONLY AFTER THE RAW TRANSCRIPT IS COMPLETE. IF THERE IS NO MEDICAL INFORMATION, OUTPUT No meaningful information **EXAMPLE OF RAW TRANSCRIPT:** [Insert a short, error-free, nuance-preserving transcript example here that clearly demonstrates an accurate, verbatim capture of speech, including disfluencies and repetitions, with no formatting steps included.] **INPUT:** {input} ***BEGIN TRANSCRIPTION***",
