üìù Generation Instructions

Transcript Generation

Speaker Tags: Clearly label dialogue using only "Doctor:", "Patient:", and "Caregiver:" (when applicable). Avoid non-speech actions (e.g., "nods", "quietly").

Natural Conversation: Dialogue should organically include all provided clinical details without explicitly dividing sections (e.g., Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan).

Realistic Speech Patterns: Incorporate natural human speech characteristics such as hesitations ("um", "well"), repetitions, clarifications, and questions reflecting genuine patient uncertainty or concern.

Patient-Centric Dialogue: Ensure frequent, realistic patient or caregiver inquiries or clarifications. Doctor responses should be clear, empathetic, and concise, using clinical terminology only if explained clearly in lay terms upon patient request.

Emotionally Nuanced: Include realistic emotional reactions (anxiety, relief, curiosity) as new clinical information or instructions are communicated.

Comprehensive Length: The dialogue must be detailed, covering the clinical situation thoroughly, reflecting realistic length and complexity of actual medical consultations.

Practical Next Steps: Clearly communicate necessary follow-up actions, specific instructions, treatment plans, medications (including normalized medication references when applicable), lifestyle recommendations, and required monitoring, embedded naturally in the conversation.

JSON Summary Generation

Produce a structured JSON summary that concisely captures:

Chief Complaint: Patient's primary concern translated into medically precise language.

Symptoms: Structured representation of symptoms with descriptors (onset, duration, severity).

SOAP Classification: Assignment of information into Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan categories, consistent with clinical documentation standards.

Red Flags: Identification and explicit labeling of urgent or emergent symptoms.

Medication: Standardized representation of medications mentioned, normalizing brand names or informal mentions into structured clinical format.

Clinical Ambiguities: Clearly note any uncertainties or ambiguities acknowledged during the encounter.

Follow-Up Actions: Clear documentation of recommended next steps, including appointments, monitoring, or referrals.
