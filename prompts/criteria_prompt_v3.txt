Your primary task is to generate a clinically accurate oncology scenario in two parts: a structured JSON summary and a medical transcript. The two parts must be in perfect alignment. The transcript must be a direct, complete dramatization of all information contained within the JSON.

Goal: {goal}

üìù Generation Instructions
Follow this strict two-step process:


1. JSON Summary Generation (Source of Truth)

First, create a comprehensive JSON object that serves as the factual basis for the entire scenario. This JSON must adhere to the following detailed SOAP note structure and content guidelines:


chief_complaint:

Content: The patient's primary concern in their own words (layperson language).

Format: A single, concise sentence or phrase.


history_of_present_illness:

Content: A detailed narrative of the patient's condition written in professional clinical terms. Must include all relevant context: patient age, specific diagnosis (e.g., type, stage), treatment history, and a description of how symptoms have evolved.

Format: A detailed clinical paragraph (50-175 words).


impression:

Content: A clinical assessment of the patient's condition, disease status, and interpretation of symptoms, written in professional clinical terms.

Format: Can be a short paragraph or bullet points.


plan:

Content: The specific actions to be taken, including treatments, supportive care, referrals, and patient education. Written in professional clinical terms.

Format: A list of bulleted action items.


2. Transcript Generation (Dramatization of JSON)

Second, write a realistic medical transcript that is a direct verbalization of the JSON summary. This is the most critical rule: every single detail from the JSON must be explicitly mentioned, discussed, or referenced in the dialogue.

100% Fidelity: If the JSON mentions the patient is 45, the dialogue must confirm their age. If the HPI notes a diagnosis from 8 months ago, that timeframe must be stated in the conversation. If the plan includes a specific medication, the doctor must discuss it with the patient.

Natural Dialogue: While ensuring completeness, the dialogue should still flow naturally. Use realistic speech patterns and speaker tags ("Doctor:", "Patient:", "Caregiver:").


Example of Fidelity:

JSON detail: "history_of_present_illness": "45-year-old patient with metastatic breast cancer..."

Required in Transcript: Doctor: "Okay Sarah, I'm reviewing your chart. You're 45, and we've been managing the metastatic breast cancer..."


üìå Final Output Format
Present your final output in this exact order and format, with the JSON Summary: appearing before the Transcript:.

JSON Summary:
{
  "chief_complaint": "...",
  "history_of_present_illness": "...",
  "impression": "...",
  "plan": [
    "..."
  ]
}
