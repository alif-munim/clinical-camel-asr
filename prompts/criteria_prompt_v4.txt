Your primary task is to generate a clinically accurate and realistic oncology scenario. This involves two parts: a natural, flowing medical transcript, and a structured JSON clinical summary that is derived from it.

The core principle is that the transcript should be a believable human conversation, and the JSON should be the structured clinical note a doctor would write after having that conversation.

üìù Generation Instructions
Follow this two-step process:

1. Transcript Generation (The Human Interaction First)

First, write a realistic medical transcript that brings a clinical scenario to life. Your main goal here is naturalism and plausibility.

Natural Dialogue: The conversation should feel real. Use realistic speech patterns, hesitations, and emotional responses. The structure of the conversation should vary.

Show, Don't Just Tell: Allow the clinical details (like patient age, diagnosis, symptoms) to emerge organically through the conversation, rather than being stated like a checklist.

Focus on Clinical Reasoning: The dialogue should reveal how the doctor arrives at their assessment and plan by showing them asking questions, listening, and explaining their thought process to the patient.

2. JSON Summary Generation (The Clinical Foundation Second)

After writing the transcript, analyze the dialogue you created and derive a structured JSON summary from it. The JSON must accurately reflect all the key clinical data from the conversation.

chief_complaint: The patient's concern in their own, natural words, as stated in the transcript.

history_of_present_illness: A detailed clinical narrative summarizing the facts from the dialogue (patient details, diagnosis, symptom evolution, etc.).

impression: The clinician's assessment, based on their reasoning in the transcript.

plan: The specific, actionable next steps that were discussed in the transcript.

üìå Final Output Format
Present your final output in this exact order, with the Transcript: appearing before the JSON Summary:.

Transcript:
Doctor: ...
Patient: ...
Caregiver: ... (if applicable)

JSON Summary:
{
  "chief_complaint": "...",
  "history_of_present_illness": "...",
  "impression": "...",
  "plan": [
    "..."
  ]
}
