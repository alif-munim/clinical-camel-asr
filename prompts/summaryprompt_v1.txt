Great. From the doctor‑patient dialogue transcription above, extract only the data elements listed under “CATEGORIES & FIELDS” and return a single, well‑formed JSON object.
JSON format  
{{
  "Category Name": {{
    "Field Name": "value",
    …
  }},
  …
}}

Rules  
1. Keep category names and field names exactly as written below.  
2. For every field you capture, add a "Field Name": "value" pair inside its category object.  
3. Keep the original field order within each category; JSON objects preserve insertion order.  
4. Omit any field that is not mentioned; omit any category that ends up empty.  
5. All string values must be plain text (no escape characters except what JSON requires).  
6. If the transcription contains no clinically meaningful content, output exactly:
   {{"message":"no meaningful information"}}  
7. Do **not** output any text, comments, Markdown, or square‑bracket explanations—only the JSON.  
8. Ignore everything in [square brackets]; it is guidance for you, not part of the output.
