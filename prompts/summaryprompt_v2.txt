From the doctor-patient dialogue transcription above, conduct a thorough medical data extraction following these guidelines:

1. OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Return a single, well-formed JSON object matching exactly the structure below
- Use ONLY the specified category names and field names
- Maintain original field ordering within categories
- Include ALL available data points that fit the categories below
- Omit completely empty categories

2. DATA EXTRACTION RULES:
- Extract ALL clinically relevant information with maximum granularity
- For fields with narrative sections: Include complete symptom descriptions with durations, temporal patterns, and qualifiers
- For history items: Capture complete historical context including timeframes
- For physical exam findings: Note laterality, severity descriptors, and provocation factors when mentioned
- For medications: Include dosage frequency even if specific drug name is unknown
- For symptoms: Capture both presence and absence as documented
- For diagnostic workup: Detail all planned procedures with their purposes
- For treatment discussions: Capture all modalities mentioned (even potential future ones)

3. CLINICAL INTERPRETATION:
- Convert all clinical terminology to standardized medical phrasing
- Expand all abbreviations
- For chronological data: Explicitly note if exact dates are unavailable
- For staging/grading: Specify "not yet staged" when workup is incomplete
- For pending items: Clearly mark as "pending" or "to be scheduled"
- Where exact values aren't stated but implied: Document the implication (e.g., "controlled" for conditions)

4. OUTPUT CONSTRAINTS:
- Absolutely no additional commentary or Markdown
- No empty brackets or placeholder text
- No truncated information - include complete clinical descriptions
- Escape only characters that violate JSON formatting rules
- String values must be exact clinical representations (no paraphrasing)
